# Miscellaneous Projects
A place for smaller projects that have no other home.


## Optimisation
- N-dimensional Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO).
- N-dimensional Bees Algorithm (BA).
- Preliminary work applying PSO to ML model parameter tuning.


## Miscellaneous Maths
- How to choose best toilet simulation.
- Mandelbrot image generation.
- Sierpinski gasket animation - extended to other polygons.

## Basic Solar System simulation
- Simple simulation of planets - needs work.


## Anime Recommenders
- Uses [Kitsu][kitsu] API to retrieve user/item data.
- Data stored locally in mongodb.
- Preliminary work on content based recommender.
- Preliminary work on SVD based collaborative filtering recommender.
